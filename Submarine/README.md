<h1>Submarine</h1>

<h2>A Universal Windows Program C++/CLI application for controlling the submarine remote operated vehicle</h2>

Solution for Visual Studio 2017 or greater

Requires a relatively up-to-date Windows 10 installation

Requires ffmpeg, FFmpegInterop. From https://github.com/Microsoft/FFmpegInterop

Vehicle control is compatable with mice, keyboards, touch screens, and xinput gamepads.

The only way I could make this work is by reordering a piece of FFmpegInterop sample code.
So, the relevant source code files are in /Samples/MediaPlayerCPP

Documentation as extensive as I can make it is included in the form of comments, please begin by reading my comments in MainPage.xaml.cpp
